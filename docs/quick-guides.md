# Quick guides

## Supporting components

For easier application management, usually you want to integrate Spotfire with a series of supporting components.

Typical supporting components are for observability, such as for logging and metrics, and security, such as identity management.

Spotfire supports standard interfaces such as OpenMetrics, LDAP, OAuth2.0, and so on, to integrate with best-in-breed cloud native components.

The following are quick starting guides for some common supporting components:
- [Logging with EFK](logging-with-efk.md)
- [Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana](monitoring-with-prometheus.md)
- [Autoscaling with KEDA](autoscaling-with-keda.md)

**Note**: We do not support or promote specific supporting components. These quick start guides are provided only as examples.
