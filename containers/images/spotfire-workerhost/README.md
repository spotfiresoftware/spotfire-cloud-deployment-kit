## About this Image

This directory contains the container recipe for the common software dependencies required by the **SpotfireÂ®** services using .NET.

Any additional libraries or software, e.g. odbc drivers, that is needed for certain components to work needs to be installed when building the container, see example file [install-odbc-driver.sh](scripts/install-odbc-drivers.sh)
