## How to build this image

**Note**: The easiest and recommended way to build all the Spotfire container images is using the provided containers `Makefile` as described in [Build the images](../../README.md#build-the-images).

You can also build this image individually. 
Follow the instructions below or adjust them according to your needs.

Prerequisites:
- You have built the [spotfire-workerhost](../spotfire-workerhost/README.md) container image.

Steps:
1. Copy the `Spotfire.Dxp.netcore-linux.sdn` package into the `build/` directory within this folder.
2. From the `<this-repo>/containers` folder, run `make spotfire-automationservices` to build this image, or `make spotfire-automationservices --dry-run` to just view the commands.

### Adding custom Spotfire packages
At build time, put custom spk files in the `build/` folder.

## How to use this image

Prerequisites:
- A running [spotfire server](../spotfire-server/README.md) container instance to connect to.
- Spotfire client packages deployed to a deployment area so that the required licenses exist for `spotfire-automationservices` to start.

```bash
