# spotfire-deployment

## About this Image

This directory contains the official container recipe for the **TIBCO SpotfireÂ® deployment package**.

This container stores the client deployment file `Spotfire.Dxp.sdn` in `/opt/tibco/deployment-files/`.
This way, it can be used as an init-container configuration job to create and populate a Spotfire deployment area.

## How to build this image
